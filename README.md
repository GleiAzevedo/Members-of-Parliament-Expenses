# Members of Parliament - Expenses

# Introduction

This project aims to analyse the annual budget, costs and claims made by each Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom in the period 2022 - 2023. In addition to the annual salary, MPs also receive expenses to cover the costs of running an office, employing staff, having somewhere to live in London or their constituency, and travelling between Parliament and their constituency. One Member of Parliament in the House of Commons represents a single constituency. Needless to say how adamant it is that MPs observe certain ethical standards in their duty as servants of the public and stewards of public resources. On the other hand, the scrutinity carried out on their expenses should also be reviwed by the public. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to break down their expenses, also considering their constituency and political party. 

# Dataset description

The dataset used in this project is mainly made up by the data avalaible on the IPSA website. IPSA, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, is the independent body that regulates and administers the business costs and decides the pay and pensions of the elected MPs and their staff in the UK. Complementary to this data, it was necessary to create two other tables, with publicly available information, about the party each MP was affiliated, as well as the administrative geography of the constituency they represent.
Below you can find a diagram of the database used in this analysis.

+ The fact table contains the main information about each budget, the reason for that budget and its and expense (Office, staffing, winding-up, accommodation, travel and subsistence and other costs, the last two being unlimited) claimed by 661 MPs.
+ The MPs table covers the details about MPs, their names and party
+ Finally, the Region table presents the constituency they represent and some classification, as the designation, whether it is a borough constituency (predominantly urban area) or a county constituency (predominantly rural), the region and country to that belongs.
