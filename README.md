# Members of Parliament - Expenses

# Introduction

This project aims to analyse the annual budget, costs and claims made by each member of parliament in the United Kingdom in the period 2022 - 2023. In addition to the annual salary, MPs also receive expenses to cover the costs of running an office, employing staff, having somewhere to live in London or their constituency, and travelling between Parliament and their constituency. The purpose of this project is to break down their expenses, also considering their constituency and political party. 

# Dataset description

The dataset used in this project is mainly made up by the data avalaible on the IPSA website. IPSA, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, is the independent body that regulates and administers the business costs and decides the pay and pensions of the elected MPs and their staff in the UK. Complementary to this data, it was necessary to create two others tables, with publicly available information, about the party each MP was affiliated, as well as the administrative geography of the constituency they represent.
Below you can find a diagram of the database used in this analysis. The fact table contains the main information, about the budgets and expenses claimed, while the two dimension tables covers the details about the MPs names and party, and the constituency they represent.
