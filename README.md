# Members-of-Parliament

This project aims to analyse the annual budget, costs and claims made by each member of parliament in the period 2022 - 2023. The dataset used in this project is avalaible on the IPSA website. IPSA, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, is the independent body that regulates and administers the business costs and decides the pay and pensions of the elected MPs and their staff in the UK.
